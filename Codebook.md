It also has 75 variables, the first two are "subject" and "activity". The rest are compose by the mean and standard deviations of the following measurements:

  tBodyAcc-XYZ

  tGravityAcc-XYZ

  tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

  tBodyGyro-XYZ

  tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

  tBodyAccMag

  tGravityAccMag

  tBodyAccJerkMag

  tBodyGyroMag

  tBodyGyroJerkMag

  fBodyAcc-XYZ

  fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  
  fBodyGyro-XYZ

  fBodyAccMag

  fBodyAccJerkMag

  fBodyGyroMag

  fBodyGyroJerkMag
  
There are exacly 73 measurement variables, excluding "subject" and "activity". The measurements are the averages of each variable for each activity and each subject.
